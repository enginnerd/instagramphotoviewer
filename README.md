Walkthrough of all user stories:
The login credentials were scrubbed from the video walkthrough.
The viewing of the self feed is not shown to protect the content of some private feeds (ping me if a demonstration is needed)

The client id was stripped from the code, add your own if you wish to compile and update the redirect URL too.
